# CyberPunk-Poetry-3.0
Underground French cyberpunk poetry adapted to English:
addiction, police violence, digital sex work, late capitalism, junkies, cops, camgirls, algorithms, hood prophets, silicon saints, teargas in the love hotel, corrupted prayers & flesh-code fusion. Raw. Glitched. Sacred & profane.
Where angels fear to thread.
